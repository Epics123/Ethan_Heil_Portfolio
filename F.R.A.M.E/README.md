F.R.A.M.E is a four-player split-screen platformer with a little twist on the classic game of tag! 
Players must run through multiple "worlds" in order to escape from an infected player. 
Once a player is tagged, they also become infected and now have to tag other players. The game is 
over when all players are infected or a non-infected player survives until time runs out. 
When there are 30 seconds remaining, a button will spawn in one of the worlds that a 
non-infected player can press to win.

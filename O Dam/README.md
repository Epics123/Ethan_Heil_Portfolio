O' Dam is a two player co-op/competitive game where players are competing against each other by placing river dams to get gold to their side of the river. However, if they end up blocking the entire river both players will lose!

This was the first game that I worked on for my Production 1 class at Champlain College. My team had three weeks to work on this project, and only two weeks to get a working digital prototype. Because of this limited amount of time, there are still many bugs that need to be ironed out and features that need to be implemented. Despite this, the core game loop is playable, minus a loss screen for daming the river.

Since there is no tutorial screen in game, refer to the VDD or VDG located in ../O_Dam/Documnets for rules and controls

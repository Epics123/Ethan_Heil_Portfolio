HotSwap is a 3D sandbox VR game where the player is a teenager who must hide all of the 
illicit in their room before mom gets home!

This game was made for a 48 hour game jam and it is very incompete. As of right now it 
is just a sandbox where you can mess around with all of the items in the room. Our team
hopes to continue working on it more in the future.

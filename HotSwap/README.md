# Ethan_Heil_Portfolio/HotSwap

HotSwap is a 3D sandbox VR game where the player is a teenager who must hide all of the 
illicit in their room before mom gets home!

I worked on Hot Swap as a part of a 48 hour game jam during my spring 2020 semester at Champlain. 
I was on a 10 person team with 1 producer, 2 designers, 3 programmers, and 4 artists, and
I was responible for some of the visual effects in the game as well as object interaction. 
This was my first time ever working on a VR game, but it was fun to try and tackle a new challenge 
in a short period of time. Unfortunatly, because it took the team a while to get the hang of working 
with VR we were only able to get a working sandbox with a few core mechanics. 
Messing around in VR is always fun though!

# Ethan_Heil_Portfolio/Spyder

Infiltrate the evil Wasp HQ as the top secret agent Spyder. Use your webs to swing around, but avoid the laser beams in the 70s throwback. 
Use your webs to swing around on levels in your own way. Avoid the deadly laser beams and cameras to stay stealthy in this tricky platformer. 
Do you have what it takes to be a secret agent?

Spyder was the final game that I worked on for my Game Production 1 class during the Spring 2020 semester. I was on a team of 8 people: 1 producer, 
2 artists, 2 designers, and 3 programmers, and we were given 6 weeks to commplete the project. I mainly worked on the grappling hook physics, lighting, 
and scene transitions, along with managing the team's version control workflow. I was also responsible for putting together a workable build for each 
sprint check in. The biggest challenge for this project was transitioning to an entirely remote workflow amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
